I had a lot of fun creating this one page React app using NASA's Astronomy Picture Of the Day (APOD).

Known issues:

- unresponsive design : the sizes of the images is not well defined and should change according to the device screen size.
- heart logo for the "Like" action is horrible. It was the best free one I could find.
